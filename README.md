Duties 2.0 for the new Minecraft API (Workbench)
================================================

Duties provides a/multiple mode(s) for admins and mods (these who do have the permission) which lets you save all your survival stuff and later be able to revert back to it. For example, you are adventuring in a cave, and someone tells you that someone has griefed his house. Just type /dutymode and go investigate it. When you're done, just type /dutymode again, and you are back with all your stuff you had before. 

The planned release time is around halloween, after Minecraft 1.4 has been released. Until then I will keep updating Duties 1.x (http://bit.ly/Nqadlg) in case there's a reported bug, something breaks.
